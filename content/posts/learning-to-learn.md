When it comes to learning new skills, we all learn in our own ways. Last year I read an interesting article on CSS-Tricks by Sarah Drasner about this topic. If you've never heard her speak at a conference, I highly recommend you looking up some on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sarah+Drasner) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/search?q=Sarah+Drasner). I was fortunate enough to attend a [talk](https://vimeo.com/348717993) of her's last year, where she wrote a VueJS app from scratch. Impressive is an understatement. Her methods, outlined in the article made me ponder about the ways I learn new skills and if they could be improved upon.
