I hope that you are able to stay home from work during this time instead of having to worry about if anyone in your office has the Corona virus. The Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was first detected in China and today, has spread to more than 100 locations internationally. 

With the current situation going on with the Corona virus (COVID-19), I wanted to find out what official websites are out there, relating to this virus then run a Web Accessibility audit on them.
