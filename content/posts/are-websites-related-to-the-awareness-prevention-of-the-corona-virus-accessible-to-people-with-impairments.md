I hope that you can stay home from work during this time instead of having to worry about if anyone in your office is exhibiting symptoms of the Coronavirus. I received word from my employer that everyone is transitioning to work from home, which I'm glad to hear. The Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was first detected in China. As of today, it has spread to more than 100 locations internationally. This disease causes respiratory issues and has various cases from mild to deadly.

With the current situation going on with the Coronavirus, I wanted to find out if websites informing the public regarding symptoms, prevention and anything related, can be accessed by anyone. I chose websites that appeared at or near the top of the search results, since those are usually the most likely to be clicked.
