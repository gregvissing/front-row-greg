I hope that you are able to stay home from work during this time instead of having to worry about if anyone in your office is exhibiting symptoms of the Coronavirus. I received word from my employer that everyone is transitioning to work from home, which I'm glad to hear. The Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was first detected in China. As of today, it has spread to more than 100 locations internationally. This disease causes respiratory issues and has various cases from mild to deadly.

With the current situation going on with the Coronavirus, I wanted to find out if websites informing the public about symptoms, prevention and anything related, are able to be accessed by anyone.
