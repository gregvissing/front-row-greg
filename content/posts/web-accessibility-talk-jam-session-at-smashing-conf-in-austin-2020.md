* Outline slide using strong and uncluttered points
* Less is more

  * Cut out unnecessary slides
  * Get rid of anything extraneous
* Write a script

  * Loose script based on what I want to say to say to supplement slides
  * Try not to sound stale or rehearsed, but still able to refer to specific points.
* Begin with an image

* Capitalize on something recent
* Time yourself beforehand
* Have a backup
* Know the technology
