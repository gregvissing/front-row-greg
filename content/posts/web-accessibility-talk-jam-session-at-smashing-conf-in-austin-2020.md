16 Ways to Prepare for a Lightning Talk ([source](https://www.semrush.com/blog/16-ways-to-prepare-for-a-lightning-talk/)).

* Research the Audience

  * Skip introductory slides (ex., "this is SEO...").
  * Avoid addressing anything too in-depth

* Outline slide using strong and uncluttered points
* Less is more
  * Cut out unnecessary slides
  * Get rid of anything extraneous

* Write a script
  * Loose script based on what I want to say to say to supplement slides
  * Try not to sound stale or rehearsed, but still able to refer to specific points.

* Begin with an image
  * Slides split with graphics and bulleted text. 
  * After my intro slide, I began with a graphic and a quote.

* Capitalize on something recent
  * Show recent work
  
* Time yourself beforehand
  * Use timer for practice
  * Be mindful of attendees and fellow presenters
  
* Have a backup
  * Save on thumb drive and Google drive

* Know the technology
  * Find out what OS I'll be using and what kind of microphone speakers will use

* Speak slowly
  * Rehearse and breathe

* Try to get a laugh, but don't force it

* Have a designated place for business cards

* Engage on social media
  * hashtag to your presentation to encourage conversation.

* Learn from the experience
  * Watch presenters who go before me so I don't repeat any mistakes they might make.
