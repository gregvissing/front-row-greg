**16 Ways to Prepare for a Lightning Talk** ([source](https://www.semrush.com/blog/16-ways-to-prepare-for-a-lightning-talk/)).

* Research the Audience

  * Skip introductory slides (ex., "this is SEO...").
  * Avoid addressing anything too in-depth
* Outline slide using strong and uncluttered points
* Less is more

  * Cut out unnecessary slides
  * Get rid of anything extraneous
* Write a script

  * Loose script based on what I want to say to say to supplement slides
  * Try not to sound stale or rehearsed, but still able to refer to specific points.
* Begin with an image

  * Slides split with graphics and bulleted text. 
  * After my intro slide, I began with a graphic and a quote.
* Capitalize on something recent

  * Show recent work
* Time yourself beforehand

  * Use timer for practice
  * Be mindful of attendees and fellow presenters
* Have a backup

  * Save on thumb drive and Google drive
* Know the technology

  * Find out what OS I'll be using and what kind of microphone speakers will use
* Speak slowly

  * Rehearse and breathe
* Try to get a laugh, but don't force it
* Have a designated place for business cards
* Engage on social media

  * hashtag to your presentation to encourage conversation.
* Learn from the experience

  * Watch presenters who go before me so I don't repeat any mistakes they might make.

**Giving a good lightning talk** ([source](https://software.ac.uk/home/cw11/giving-good-lightning-talk))

* Make your point, Make it quickly

  * Think about what you are trying to get your audience to discover! If you are talking about your work, are you presenting the audience with an unsolved question? Or an inspirational answer! Make it your title, so that people have had time to digest it and get interested.
  * Get to your point early on. Don't leave it to the end. If you can make your point in 1 minute or 1 slide then go for it.
* Don't sweat the small stuff

  * Lightning talks are there to enable the audience to review as many potentially exciting ideas as possible in a short space of time. You are not there to provide the detail required for them to reproduce your work, you're there to inspire them to search out your work.
  * Use large images and as little text as possible. Don't crowd and confuse with unnecessary information - have a pointer to a website or email at the start and/or on every slide to give your audience more. You might even like to use the Takahashi method which uses only one or two words per slide.
* When structuring your slides don't worry about taking wild leaps, and when talking provide the minimum amount of background to give the context to make your point.
* People want to discover something new, not everything there is to know about it.
* Get comfortable

  * Practice against a timer. Practice standing up. Five minutes is a really short time when presenting. And yet make sure you go slow and steady and reduce the amount you say rather than rushing to try and cram more in.
  * Make sure you know how the microphone and other A/V facilities work. Understand when you'll be presenting and be ready to speak.
  * And remember, the audience is on your side!

In summary, remember that***DELIVERY is more important than CONTENT***. This doesn't mean that your content shouldn't be good, but that it is always better to get across something that sticks in your audience's mind, than getting them to forget everything you've just said.

After all, you want them to come and ask you questions in the coffee break!
