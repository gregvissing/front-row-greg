I'm pleased to welcome you to my first blog post on Web Accessibility. If you've never heard of it, I hope that this website will serve as a resource to keep you up-to-date on what it is and why it's needed.

## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility is defined as the availability to every individual regardless of disability, situation or other factors.

## Who all is involved in Accessibility?

## What type of business is most at Risk?

## What took so long for Accessibility to become a big topic?

## What impairments must we consider in making a website Accessible?

This impairment applies to people with low vision, color blindness and blindness. They often have to rely on the following to use the web:
