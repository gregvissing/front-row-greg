After meeting with my supervisor in January, we both agreed that it was time for me to add to my job description, based on my work and new skills learned with the possibility of moving up to a Senior level. This made me feel a sense of pride, knowing that all the hard work I've put in since I started in the Web Development fields, has paid off.

  * Overview of Update Process

    * Updates can be done at any time of year but usually are completed prior to or during the annual performance evaluation period, or prior to creating a posting.
    * Updates for non-faculty positions should be completed online using Workday, by initiating an[Edit Position Restrictions](https://employees.tamu.edu/compensation/job-changes/edit-position-restrictions/ "Edit Position Restrictions"). Auditors rely on the online system for the most current PD for a non-faculty position in a Texas A&M department.
    * The Edit Position Restrictions should always be initiated by the HR Liaison in your department to ensure proper routing in Workday. For an update not involving a title change, the reason that should be selected is "Update."
