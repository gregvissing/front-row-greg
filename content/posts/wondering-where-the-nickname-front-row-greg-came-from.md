I'm sure by now you've wondered where such a nickname like "Front Row Greg" came from. Below is my story about how this nickname came about.

It all started in 2019 while attending [SmashingConf](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019) up in Toronto, Canada. Click the link to learn more about this great conference! I was excited about the lineup of speakers, but I was particularly interested in the talk regarding [Digital Policy](https://vimeo.com/348952186) by Kristina Podnar. I went to the [Jam Session](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/jam-session) meet-up the night before the first day of talks, where a few of the speakers did a panel Q&A session. Kristina Podnar just so happened to be one of the speakers on the panel, so when their panel session was done I went straight over to her to tell her how excited I was that she was speaking on Digital Policy. I explained that we were in the beginning phases of redesigning our website because it was lacking in accessibility. Although she didn't have a lot of time to talk, she was definitely interested in hearing more so she asked me to Tweet her the URL of our website. [here](https://vimeo.com/348952186#t=1793s)
